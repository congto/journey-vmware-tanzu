A three-part initiative **The Journey to VMware Tanzu** held at VMUG Bulgaria between 06.07.2021 and 20.07.2021

# Part 2: Deploying a small Kubernetes cluster 
* Will take place on: 2021.07.13 / 18:30 / on-line

# Part 3: Deploying a basic VMware Tanzu infrastructure

Each folder (part-x) contains files stored in the following structure:
* *demo-files* folder contains the sample configuration files
* *docker-images* folder and its sub-folders contain the files necessary to produce the referred container images. You may use your own images, but keep in mind that you should adjust the configuration files as well
* *exercise-files* folder contains a set of configuration files suitable for a guided exercise
* *demo-script.txt* file contains the commands used during the demo
* *slides.pdf* file contains the slides of the presentation

For better experience load the *demo-script.txt* file in an editor with an integrated terminal (like Visual Studio Code, Kate, Atom, Sublime, etc.), highlight and execute commands one by one, and check the results.

This is inspired and based on the **k8s-intro** initiative of mine. The supporting materials and all related information can be found at https://github.com/shekeriev/k8s-intro
